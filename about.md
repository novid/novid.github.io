## General Information
Hi, my name is _Navid Emami_ and i'm a **Software Engineer** located in Tehran, Iran.
I first started Web Development 8 years ago (2009 i think) and soon fell in love with [Drupal](https://drupal.org).
Since there, my major activities was based on **Drupal** and worked two years in a Drupal based company in Tehran.

In meantime, i switched my development environment to _GNU/Linux_ specially [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com)
which brought me to a whole new area in IT industry that is called **System Administration**.
So, i decided to be verified in this area and soon i found [Linux Professional Institute](http://lpi.org)
and hopefully there was a company in Tehran which performs LPI exams (you barely have access to these materials in Iran, believe me).

My general activities in IT world is as follows:

- GNU/Linux System Administration

- Web Development based on Drupal (medium & large scale projects)
