## Drupal User Guide in Persian (Farsi)
During a decade of using Drupal, i really understood the concept of open source community and why it matters. That is why you see Drupal's slogan as: **come for software, stay for community**. I remember using Drupal 5 as a simple **Blogging System**, Drupal 6 as a **Content Management System** and Drupal 7 as a **Content Management Framework**. Now in the days of Drupal 8 i don't know what should we call the giant codebase, maybe **Content Management Infrastructure** but it is more than a software for managing content on the web and it is the most complex version released since it's birth on 2001.

All these new and complex materials in Drupal 8 could be illustrated with step by step tutorials for beginners to get started. That is why [Drupal User Guide](https://drupal.org/project/user_guide) started in June of 2015 regarding to upcoming version of Drupal. With every minor version of Drupal 8, this project gets updated with new concepts in Core. So, after reading the whole document and the way it's translation process works, i started to translate English version into Persian (Farsi) during summer 2017 and now it is ready for use with Drupal 8.3.

Topics described in [Drupal User Guide](https://drupal.org/fa/docs/user_guide/fa/index.html) are:
