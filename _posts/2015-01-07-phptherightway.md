title: PHP - The Right Way, Persian Translation
---

## Dedicated to Persian PHP Community

One of the challenging aspects of software engineering process is documentation and for international projects is **localization** or simply _l10n_. There are a lot of resources about each and every topic that you can imagine for software development best practices. In PHP community, the presense of [PHP: The Right Way](http://phptherightway.com) and it's well known contributers with tons of languages available surprised me and minutes after reading the document i had the same question: why there is no translation for my language? So, i started the translation process and after a while (about a season) full Persian translation is avilable through [PHP: The Right Way, Persian Translation](http://novid.github.io/php-the-right-way). Topics included in this version are:

* Code Style Guide
* Language Highlights
* Dependency Management
* Coding Practices
* Dependency Injection
* Databases
* Templating
* Errors and Exceptions
* Security
* Testing
* Servers and Deployment
* Caching

Although the base document is changing daily and one person can't simply be updated with source, there are a lot of ways so solve this problem and many of them are present right now because of **GitHub** and it's collaboration process. So, if you are a Persian developer and want to improve this document, just do it! Even you don't have to contact me for this (though i would be happy to meet new people).

Have fun and remember: __in order to be a Free Software or Open Source contributer you SHOULD act and be a true activism because thinking about your way is not enough__. Damn man, i should work with RMS :)
