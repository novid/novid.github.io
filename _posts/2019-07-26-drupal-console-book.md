## Drupal Console Book in Persian (Farsi)
With introduction of [Drupal 8](https://drupal.org/8) in 2015 and it's major changes, things started to become more difficult for new and even experienced developers to upgrade their Drupal 6/7 sites or start from scratch in Drupal 8. At the time, **Drush** was the go to tool for managing Drupal projects in different versions but a new tool was required specifically for latest version of Drupal, named [Drupal Console](https://drupalconsole.com).

From managing your site's configuration to developing new modules and themes in the command line, Drupal Console is the number one tool in order to design, implement and maintenance of small, medium and large projects. Like any other Open Source project, Drupal Console is standing on the shoulders of **Symfony Console**, so why not give it a try? This project is dedicated to Drupal's Persian (Farsi) teams and members.

Topics described in [Drupal Console Book](https://drupal-console.web.app/docs/fa-ir) are:

* What is Drupal Console
* Getting the Project
* Usage
* Available Commands
* Site Aliases
* Chain Commands
* Custom Commands
* Contributing New Features
* FAQs
* References
