title: PHP - The Wrong Way, Persian Translation
---

## Dedicated to Persian PHP Community

In contrast to [PHP: The Right Way](http://phptherightway.com), the focus of
this document is mainly based on why all these trends in PHP community formed
and how can we, as computer scientists and software engineers, find the best
solution on a particular problem and keep our mind open for different scenarios.
This is a much more philosophical writing rather than technical.So, be careful!

Topics described in [PHP - The Wrong Way](http://phpthewrongway.com) are:

* The Danger of Extremism
* Always use a Framework
* Always use a Design Pattern
* Always use Object-Oriented Programming
* Being Afraid of other People's Code
* Following the PHP-FIG standards Religiously
* Neglecting Security
